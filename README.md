This code is for doing data wrangling and perform machine learning models including logistic regression, random forest, SGD classification, KNN, decision tree, gaussian naive Bayes, SVM. 
Technically, the code can be run on any pandas data frame by just doing a little modification. 
To familiar with this code, someone may want to use the open source dataset: https://github.com/Freiburg-AI-Research/Paro_COPD to do some practice.
